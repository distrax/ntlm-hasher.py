# ntlm-hasher.py
Script to hash a wordlist into the Windows NTLM format line by line and print it to stdout.

<del>Still having issues. I am able to add a word to the code and it will print out the correct hash but when running through the file the hashes are incorrect. I already stripped out the newline characters.</del>

All is working. Maybe my other system has a python issue. I made almost no changes for it to work properly on two systems other than the first. 

Next I want to add additional functions for various hashing algorithms and take user input to call the desired function from a dictionary. Then to provide the option to hash one passphrase through input as an alternative to the file loop if desired. 

I'm aware that my proficiency is laughable no need to remind me. :)
