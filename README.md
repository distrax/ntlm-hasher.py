# ntlm-hasher.py
Script to hash a wordlist into the Windows NTLM format line by line and print it to stdout.

Still having issues. I am able to add a word to the code and it will print out the correct hash but when running through the file the hashes are incorrect. I already stripped out the newline characters.
